# Quotes App Ang2/4

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

## Run the application locally

Clone this repo from the terminal   
`git clone git@github.com:nenoch/ang2-quotes-app.git`   
then move to the main directory `cd ang2-quotes-app`

Run the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) server `npm run server`, and your local [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) `mongod` in two different terminal windows.
Run `ng serve` for the frontend in a third window. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the angular files. For changes in the server files stop and start again the node server.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are running the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) server `npm run server`, and your local [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) `mongod` in two different terminal windows.   
_Note: tests run on the development database. The last test clears it of any change._
